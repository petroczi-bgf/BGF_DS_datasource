##First Assignment Instructions

This assignment is graded through Coospace but you need to submit your work on Github.

You need to answer to the questions with SQL code with the related results. The assignment is based on the Chinook.db, so you need to use this database.

So each submission has a task sequence named sql file with .sql extension and the same filename with the results but the extension is .txt.


e.g.:

1.sql

	select * from blabla

1.txt

	id|some col

	1 |some text


##How to produce these files

Open sqlite command-line and tune the mode, headers etc.

Create the .sql files and with a text editor develop your sql queries.

You can use .read <.sql file> to run queries against the db.

If you think you got the right answer with .once <.txt file> you can redirect the results to a file. Please note you have to run the query again after you setting the .once. 


##How to submit your Github work on Coospace

You need to submit 2 things. 

1. Link to your github repo

2. Your last commit's sha1 hash.

To get your commit footprint you need to navigate to Github and open your repo.

Click on the commits what is highlighted with yellow on the picture. [Image1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/u7g4rxg72flrb4l/1github.PNG?dl=0)

Now there is an icon also highlighted with yellow, hit it and your SHA1 is copied. [Image2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9gcxcq2ih57fwq2/2github.PNG?dl=0)
